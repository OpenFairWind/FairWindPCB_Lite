# FairWindPCB_Lite
NMEA / SeaTalk gateway for Arduino Mega

Marine electronics plays an important role in now a day boating
sailing and yachting. The last generation up to dated multifunctional
displays are a crucial component in modern yacht gears.
The spread of sofisticated navigational aids gather the rise of a
easy navigation feeling. Navigation, both on powerboats and sailing
boats as well, is not easy. It could be confortable, but is a load
of responsabilities that the sailor holds on him/herself, on
his/her guests, on rescuers in case of accident and on the marine
environment. 
The FairWind project fill the gap between the availability of
powerful electronic navigational aids and the knowledge about
this technology as something common in sailors' culture.

The software FairWindPCB_Lite is a NMEA and SeaTalk gateway
working on Arduino Mega 2560. The choiche of this platform is due to
the need for 3 hardware serials able to manage the 9 bits setup and
enough memory for input/output queues management.

The PCB will be release soon.
Any improvement is welcomed!
